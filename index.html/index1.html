    <h3>Lady Gaga</h3>
    <p>Hello hello baby you called<br>
I can’t hear a thing<br>
I have got no service<br>
In the club, you say? say?<br>
Wha-wha-what did you say huh?<br>
You’re breakin’ up on me<br>
Sorry I cannot hear you<br>
I’m kinda busy<br>
K-kinda busy<br>
K-kinda busy<br>
Sorry I cannot hear you I’m kinda busy<br>
<br>
Just a second<br>
It’s my favorite song they’re gonna play<br>
And I cannot text you with a drink in my hand, eh?<br>
You shoulda made some plans with me<br>
You knew that I was free<br>
And now you won’t stop calling me<br>
I’m kinda busy<br></p>
